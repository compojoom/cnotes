    <section>
      <title>Introducing CMC</title>

      <para>CMC is a Joomla extension that integrates with the <ulink
      url="https://mailchimp.com/?pid=compojoom&amp;source=website">Mailchimp</ulink>
      API. Its functionality includes, but is not limited to displaying your
      Mailchimp lists and users directly in your Joomla backend. It comes with
      a Joomla module that will let you easily create newsletter subscription
      forms on your site.</para>

            <para>Newsletter subscription. CMC makes it really easy to publish
            your Mailchimp subscription form on a Joomla based website and
            doesn't require you to create or copy/paste any HTML code.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Installation and updates</title>

    <para>Installing CMC is no different than installing any other Joomla!™
    extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions for
    installing Joomla!™ extensions on the <ulink
    url="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/">official help
    page</ulink> .Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with
    these instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

      <para>You can download the latest installation packages by visiting our
      site at <ulink
      url="https://compojoom.com">https://compojoom.com</ulink>. Go to
      Download -&gt; CMC menu item. The releases are listed in descending
      order with the newest release always on top. Click on the release number
      and then download the ZIP package.</para>

      <para>The installation package can be installed on Joomla 2.5 . You can
      use the installation package to update from previous version as well;
      just install it, without uninstalling the old package.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Updating to the latest version</title>

      <section>
        <title>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</title>

        <para>You can easily check for the latest published version of CMC by
        visiting https://compojoom.com and going to Downloads-&gt;CMC.</para>

        <para>Updating CMC to the latest version is by no means different than
        installing the component! You do not have to uninstall the previous
        version; in fact, you are discouraged from doing so. Simply follow the
        installation instructions so as to install the latest CMC version over
        the existing installation. That's all! All your settings are
        preserved.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Live update</title>

        <para>There is also an alternate update path, if your server supports
        it. It is called the "Live Update" feature (thanks to Nicholas K.
        Dionysopoulos from http://akeebabackup.com) . Whenever you click on
        the Live update button in the Navigation toolbar, it will
        automatically check for the existence of an updated version and it
        will notify you. Clicking on the update button allows you to perform a
        live update without further interaction. Do note that if your server
        is protected by a firewall you'll have to enable port 80 and 443 TCP
        traffic to https://compojoom.com for this feature to work
        properly.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Using the CMC component</title>

    <para>Congrats! It seems that you have the first step - the installation
    behind you! Now let us quickly sum up what you need to do after the
    installation. Go to the extensions dashboard -&gt; click on Options in the
    top right -&gt; provide your <ulink
    url="https://mailchimp.com/?pid=compojoom&amp;source=website">Mailchimp</ulink>
    API key and enter a webhooks key. Copy the webhooks URL to your lists
    settings on Mailchimp! Now the component is all setup and you can run your
    first synchronisation (go to the list view). Once you've run the
    synchronisation and if everything went fine you can go ahead and publish
    the subscription module and let users subscribe.</para>

    <para>This was the absolute minimum of what you need to do. If you are an
    advanced user the steps most probably didn't scare you. If on the other
    hand you didn't understand what to do let us look at each step in
    details.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Dashboard</title>

      <para>The dashboard provides you with a quick access to each view of the
      component. You also have a newsfeed module on the right that will
      display the latest information about the component taken right out of
      our blog.</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/dashboard.PNG"/>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Options</title>

      <para>From the top right of your dashboard you can access the component
      Options.</para>

      <para><graphic fileref="images/options.PNG"/>The options are divided
      into 2 tabs - "Main Settings" &amp; "Permissions" . The main settings is
      the area where you need to provide your API keys (we'll discuss that in
      a second) . Permissions is the place where you would define who is able
      to access the component in the backend. We use the standard Joomla ACL
      for that so it is best that you read the documentation available at
      <ulink
      url="http://docs.joomla.org/Access_Control_List/1.6-2.5/Tutorial">http://docs.joomla.org</ulink>
      .</para>

      <section>
        <title>Mailchimp API key</title>

        <para>In order for the component to work you will need to provide your
        Mailchimp API key. To get the key log into your profile on
        mailchimp.com . Then on the top go your account -&gt; API keys &amp;
        Authorized Apps.</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/mailchimp_api_key.png"/>

        <para>You will be presented with a list a keys similar to this
        one</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/mailchimp_api_keys.PNG"/>

        <para>Select the Mailchimp key (or if it doesn't exist create one!),
        copy it and then paste it in the Mailchimp API key in the CMC
        configuration settings.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Webhooks URL</title>

        <para>Webhooks are a way for <ulink
        url="https://mailchimp.com/?pid=compojoom&amp;source=website">Mailchimp</ulink>
        to send information related to your lists and users to your site.
        Webhooks allows CMC to offer a 2 way synchronisation of lists. In
        simple English this means that - whenever a user unsubscribes on
        Mailchimp - this will be reflected in the backend of your website.
        Whenever you modify an user on mailchimp.com -&gt; the modified
        information will be also show in your backend.</para>

        <para>In order for the webhooks support to work you need to provide
        the URL to your site in the Mailchimp list settings. Since this URL is
        publicly available it means that everyone would be able to send data
        to your site. To prevent this we automatically generate a secret key
        for your site and append it to the url. The key is like a password
        -&gt; if someone tries to call your webhooks URL without the key -&gt;
        the system will just do nothing. On the other side - if the request to
        that URL has the correct webhooks key, then the system will proceed
        with the processing of the request.</para>

        <para>So, long story short - copy the URL from the webhooks URL field
        and give it to mailchimp:</para>

        <important>
          <para>Don't forget to save the settings! If you don't do so the key
          generated for the webhook URL won't be saved and mailchimp won't be
          able to properly authenticate on your site!</para>
        </important>

        <graphic fileref="images/lists.PNG"/>

        <para>Once you've reached the list view at the top you'll see a bar
        with settings related to your list. Click on "List tools" -&gt;
        "Webhooks" as shown in the screen shot below</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/webhooks-select.png"/>

        <para>Now you should be presented with a screen similar to this
        one:</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/webhooks-add.PNG"/>

        <para>Provide the copied URL in the "Callback URL" section and click
        on "Add Webhook". If your website is reachable through the web (not an
        intranet or localhost) you should see a message that everything went
        fine.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Lists</title>

      <para>Currently the Lists view is really simple. We obviously show you
      the lists you have and some additional information about each list. On
      the top right of the screen you'll see a First Sync button. You need to
      click this one the first time after your installation. This will
      download all your lists and users from <ulink
      url="https://mailchimp.com/?pid=compojoom&amp;source=website">Mailchimp</ulink>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Users</title>

      <para>The user screen allows you to see all the users subscribed to all
      of your lists.</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/users.PNG"/>

      <para>By clicking on the email of an user you will be presented with a
      view that has more information about him. Similar to this one:</para>

      <graphic fileref="images/user.PNG"/>

      <para>You can modify the user email, names and status. You are also
      presented with the Mailchimp group and interest fields in raw form. (in
      a future version we plan to add support for editing them as well)</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Using the CMC Module</title>

    <para>When you install the CMC component, we also install a frontend
    module that you can use to display a newsletter subscription form on your
    site. Go to Extensions -&gt; Module Manager and in the list find the CMC -
    Newsletter subscription module.</para>

    <para><note>
        <para>If you don't find the module in the list click on New and then
        select the CMC - Newsletter subscription module</para>
      </note>The basic parameters of the module should look something similar
    to this:</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/mod_cmc_basic_options.PNG"/>

    <para>You need to select a list from the drop down field. Once you do this
    the page will refresh and you'll be presented with the fields and interest
    groups options for your list.</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/mod_cmc_group_options.PNG"/>

    <para>Select the fields you want to show in the frontend and click on save
    once ready.</para>

    <para><important>
        <para>Please make sure to select all the fields that you've marked as
        required in Mailchimp. Failure to do so will result in not working
        subscriptions as <ulink
        url="https://mailchimp.com/?pid=compojoom&amp;source=website">Mailchimp</ulink>
        will refuse to subscribe the users to the list, because some fields
        are missing.</para>
      </important>Depending on the fields and interest groups that you've
    selected the module will display different options in the frontend. Here
    is a screen shot of a module that has only the Email, First and Last name
    fields selected</para>

      <title>Styling the CMC module</title>

      <para>The module frontend presentation doesn't include any CSS file.
      We've left the presentation to your template. However if you are not
      happy with the way the module is styled you can always add the CSS rule
      to your template CSS file.</para>
